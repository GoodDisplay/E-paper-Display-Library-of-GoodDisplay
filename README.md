# [Our comprehensive development kits](https://www.good-display.com/product/53/) 
All the boards for STM32/ArduinoUNO/ESP32/ESP8266 have undergone an upgradation on the hardware design with following example codes changed a little bit.<br/>
So for any of our loyal supportors both old and new, if you happened to buy one of the new board from us (2022 the latter half),
you will then need to use the newest example code for each EPD model. And that's why we encourage you to use this Library!<br/>
